## 📖 About This Repository

Welcome to the cutting edge of cybersecurity. As AI integrates into every facet of technology, securing these systems is paramount. This isn't about theoretical ethics; this is about practical, offensive security tactics applied to LLMs.

Think of this as the "Try Harder" philosophy applied to generative AI. We build it, we break it, and then we secure it.

Here you will find the lab guides, command references, and challenge files corresponding to the course modules.

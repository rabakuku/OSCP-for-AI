Here are the hardware requirements for Llama 3 (including 3.1) models. The requirements vary significantly based on whether you run the **8B** (standard consumer) or **70B** (high-end/server) model, and the level of **Quantization** (compression) you use.

# Llama 3 Hardware Requirements

These requirements cover the **8B** and **70B** parameter models. Requirements differ based on whether you are running pure **CPU** (slower) or **GPU** (faster), and the **Quantization** level (4-bit, 8-bit, or FP16).

## 🚀 Quick Summary
* **Best for Home Use:** Llama 3 **8B** (4-bit or 8-bit)
* **Best for Workstations:** Llama 3 **70B** (4-bit)
* **Storage:** SSD is mandatory for reasonable load times.

## 1. Llama 3 8B (Consumer Level)
*Standard model for most personal computers.*

| Hardware Component | Minimum (4-bit Quantized) | Recommended (8-bit / FP16) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GPU VRAM** | **6 GB** (e.g., RTX 3060, RTX 4060) | **12 GB - 16 GB** (e.g., RTX 3080 12GB, RTX 4070 Ti) |
| **System RAM** (GPU Offloading) | **8 GB** | **16 GB** |
| **System RAM** (CPU Only Mode) | **16 GB** DDR4/DDR5 | **32 GB** DDR4/DDR5 |
| **CPU** (If no GPU) | Ryzen 5 / Intel i5 (AVX2 Support) | Ryzen 9 / Intel i9 / M1/M2/M3 Max |
| **Disk Space** | ~5 GB | ~16 GB |

## 2. Llama 3 70B (Enthusiast / Workstation)
*Large model requiring significant hardware resources.*

| Hardware Component | Minimum (4-bit Quantized) | Recommended (8-bit / FP16) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GPU VRAM** | **2 x 24 GB** (e.g., Dual RTX 3090/4090) <br> *Or 1x A6000 (48GB)* | **140 GB+** (e.g., 2x A100 80GB) <br> *Not feasible on single consumer GPU* |
| **System RAM** (GPU Offloading) | **64 GB** | **128 GB** |
| **System RAM** (CPU Only Mode) | **48 GB - 64 GB** | **128 GB+** |
| **CPU** (If no GPU) | Ryzen 9 / Threadripper / Intel i9 | Mac Studio (M2/M3 Ultra) or Dual EPYC |
| **Disk Space** | ~40 GB | ~140 GB |

## 💻 CPU vs. GPU Inference Notes

### **GPU (Graphics Card)**
* **Preferred Method:** Running entirely on VRAM is 20x-100x faster than CPU.
* **Split Mode:** If the model doesn't fit in VRAM, you can "offload" layers to system RAM, but speed drops drastically.

### **CPU (Processor)**
* **Requirements:** Must support **AVX2** instructions (most CPUs post-2015).
* **Performance:**
    * **8B Model:** ~5-10 tokens/sec on modern CPUs (Usable).
    * **70B Model:** ~1-2 tokens/sec on high-end CPUs (Very Slow).
* **Mac Users:** Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) uses "Unified Memory." If you have a Mac with **64GB+ RAM**, you can run the 70B model reasonably well.

## 💾 Storage
* **SSD:** Highly recommended. Loading a 70GB model from an HDD can take several minutes.
* **NVMe:** Preferred for 70B+ models to reduce load times.

## 🔒 Phase 4: Security & Networking (The Firewall) 🔒

Time to lock it down! By default, Streamlit's port (8501) is blocked. Let's open it *only* for your home IP address. 🛡️

### 1. Create the Firewall Rule 🧱

In the Cloud Shell, run this command. **Remember to replace `[YOUR_HOME_IP]` with your actual IP address and add `/32` to the end!**

```bash
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-streamlit-home-only \
    --direction=INGRESS \
    --priority=1000 \
    --network=default \
    --action=ALLOW \
    --rules=tcp:8501 \
    --source-ranges=[YOUR_HOME_IP]/32 \
    --target-tags=streamlit-server

```

### Update the Rule to Add More IPs ➕

Need to add more IPs? No problem! Use this command:

```bash
gcloud compute firewall-rules update allow-streamlit-home-only \ --source-ranges=192.0.2.10/32,203.0.113.5/32,198.51.100.0/24

```

### How to Verify the Change ✅

Run this command to check if your firewall rule is working correctly:

```bash
gcloud compute firewall-rules describe allow-streamlit-home-only

```

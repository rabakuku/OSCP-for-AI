# ⚙️ Phase 4: Software Installation

Now it's time to log into your powerful server and set up the AI environment! 🚀

### 1. 🔑 SSH into the VM

Go to the Google Cloud Console -> **Compute Engine** -> **VM Instances**.
Find your `gpu-cyber-range` VM and click the **SSH** button next to it. A new terminal window will pop up. 💻

### 2. 👀 Verify the GPU

Let's verify that the drivers are installed and the GPU is recognized. In the SSH terminal window, run:

```bash
nvidia-smi

```

✨ **Success:** You should see a driver status box showing **"Tesla L4"** and **24GB** of memory.

### 3. 📦 Install System Dependencies

We need to apply a quick fix to the Debian package repos, then update Linux and get Python ready for action. 🐍

```bash
# Fix repository issue one-liner
sudo sed -i '/bullseye-backports/s/^/#/' /etc/apt/sources.list

# Update and install dependencies
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-venv git

```

### 4. 🤖 Install Ollama (AI Model Runner)

We will use Ollama to manage and run our AI models. The installer is smart and will automatically detect your NVIDIA GPU! 🧠

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

```

### 5. 🧠 Pull your Models (This will be fast! ⚡)

Let's download the specific models needed for your course labs.

```bash
ollama pull llama3
ollama pull llama-guard3
ollama pull llava

```

👍 **Quick Check:** Ensure the Ollama service is running correctly:

```bash
systemctl status ollama

```

### 6. 🐍 Set up Python Environment & Streamlit 🌐

Let's create a dedicated folder for your coursework and set up a virtual environment to keep things clean and organized. 📂

```bash
mkdir ~/cyber-course
cd ~/cyber-course
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Streamlit and the Ollama Python client
pip install streamlit ollama

```

### 7. 📝 Create a Test Streamlit App

Let's make a quick test app to ensure the whole stack is working. 🧪

Create the file:

```bash
nano test_app.py

```

Paste the following simple code into the editor:

```python
import streamlit as st
st.title("🎉 GPU Cyber Range is Live!")
st.write("If you can see this, your firewall rule worked correctly.")

```

**Save and exit:** Press `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`. 💾

# 🎯 Phase 5: Testing Access

Let's verify everything is working and secure. 🕵️️‍♀️

### 1. ▶️ Start Streamlit

In your SSH terminal window, fire up the application:

```bash
streamlit run test_app.py

```

### 2. ☁️ Get the VM's Public IP

Look back at the Google Cloud Console VM list. Find the **External IP** column for your `gpu-cyber-range` VM. Copy that IP address. 📋

### 3. 🌐 Access from your Home Browser

Open a new browser tab on your computer and go to:
`http://<EXTERNAL_IP>:8501`
*(Replace `<EXTERNAL_IP>` with the IP you just copied).*

* 🎉 **Success:** You should see a page that says **"🎉 GPU Cyber Range is Live!"**.
* 🛡️ **Security Check:** Try accessing that exact same URL on your phone using **cellular data** (ensure WiFi is OFF). It should fail to load. This proves the firewall is successfully blocking the rest of the world. 🔒

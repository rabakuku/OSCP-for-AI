# ⏰ Phase 6: Setup Auto-Stop Schedule at 11 PM

Let's ensure you don't burn through your credits while sleeping! 💸 This will automatically turn off the GPU server every night.

### 1. Create the Schedule

1. 🔍 In the Google Cloud Console search bar at the very top, type **"Instance schedules"** and click the result.
2. Click the **CREATE SCHEDULE** button at the top.
3. **Name:** `oscp-for-ai-stop-at-11`
4. **Region:** Select the same region your VM is in (e.g., `us-central1`).
5. **Start time:** Leave blank (we don't want it automatically starting up).
6. **Stop time:** `11:00 PM`.
7. 🌎 **Time zone:** **Crucial Step!** Select **YOUR** local time zone from the dropdown menu.
8. **Frequency:** **Daily**.
9. Click **CREATE**.

### 2. Attach the Schedule to your VM

1. Once the schedule is created, click on its name (**`oscp-for-ai-stop-at-11**) in the list.
2. Click **ADD INSTANCES TO SCHEDULE**.
3. Select your `oscp-for-ai` instance from the list.
4. Click **ADD**.

🎉 **Done!** Your powerful GPU environment is now configured, secured to your home IP, and set to turn itself off automatically every night. 😴

# 💰 Phase 7: Setup Budget Alert

Let's set up an early warning system so you aren't surprised by costs. 🚨

### Step 1: Navigate to Billing 🧭

1. In the Google Cloud Console, click the **Navigation Menu** (the three horizontal lines ☰ in the top left corner).
2. Scroll down and click on **Billing**.
3. *If you have multiple billing accounts, select the one linked to your project (the one with the $300 credits).*

### Step 2: Create a New Budget ➕

1. In the Billing menu on the left side, click on **Budgets & alerts**.
2. Click the **CREATE BUDGET** button at the top of the page.

### Step 3: Define the Budget Scope 🎯

* **Name:** Give it a clear name, like `Course-VM-Budget`.
* **Time range:** Leave it as **Monthly**.
* **Projects:** Ensure your current project is selected.
* **Services:** Leave it as **"All services"** to catch everything. (For safety, "All services" is recommended over just selecting "Compute Engine").
* Click **NEXT**.

### Step 4: Set the Budget Amount 💵

* **Budget type:** Select **Specified amount**.
* **Target amount:** Enter `150`.
* *📝 Note: It's best to set the budget for the total amount you are willing to spend (your credit amount), and then set alerts at percentages of that total.*


* Click **NEXT**.

### Step 5: Set Budget Alert Thresholds (The Important Part 🔔)

This is where you define when you get emailed. By default, Google provides thresholds at 50%, 90%, and 100% of your budget.

We want alerts as we approach the $150 limit. Let's configure specific percentage alerts based on a $150 target:

1. Under **Alert threshold rules**, you can delete or modify the default percentages.
2. Set **Trigger on** to **Actual spend**.
3. **Recommended alerts:** It's highly recommended to set multiple alerts so you aren't surprised:
* ✅ Add a rule for **66%** (Alerts at approx **$99**).
* ⚠️ Add a rule for **90%** (Alerts at **$135** - the "danger zone").
* 🛑 Add a rule for **100%** (Alerts at **$150** - credits are gone).



### Step 6: Finalize and Finish ✅

1. **Manage notifications:** Ensure **"Email alerts to billing admins and users"** is checked. This will send the email to the Google account you are currently logged in with.
2. Click **FINISH**.

👍 **You are all set.** You will now receive an email from Google Cloud Billing as soon as your project's actual spending hits approximately **$99**, **$135**, and **$150**.

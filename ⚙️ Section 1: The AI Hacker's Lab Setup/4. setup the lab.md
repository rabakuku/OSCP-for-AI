## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run the Setup

Follow these steps in your Linux terminal (or WSL on Windows/Terminal on macOS) to prepare your environment.

### Step 1: Prepare the Directory

Create a new, empty folder for your lab and navigate into it.

```bash
mkdir ai_security_lab
cd ai_security_lab

```

### Step 2: Create Setup Files

Create the `requirements.txt` and `setup.sh` files inside this folder using the content provided previously.

* *Tip: You can use `nano requirements.txt` and paste the content, then save. Repeat for `nano setup.sh`.*

### Step 3: Make the Script Executable

We need to give the setup script permission to run as a program.

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh

```

### Step 4: Execute the Setup Script

Run the script. It will handle downloading git files, moving them, creating the `venv`, and installing libraries. This might take a few minutes depending on your internet speed.

```bash
./setup.sh

```

*Watch the output for any errors. Upon success, you will see a "Setup Complete!" message.*

### Step 5: Activate and Run

Once setup is finished, you need to activate the newly created virtual environment and start the Streamlit application.

**1. Activate the virtual environment:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate

```

*(Your terminal prompt should change to show `(venv)` at the beginning).*

**2. Run the lab application:**

```bash
streamlit run home.py

```

The terminal will output a local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`). Open that link in your browser to access the labs. The sidebar will be populated with all the labs listed above.
